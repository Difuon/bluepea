## Agent Registration

Agent Registration creates a data resource corresponding to a given Agent. This
is a self-signed or self-owned data resource in that the signer field value
references is the self-same data resource.

In order to create an Agent Registration request the client application needs
to produce a unique EdDSA signing keypair using the libsodium library.

The bluepea python library has a helper function,

```python
makeSignedAgentReg(vk, sk)
```

in the

```python
bluepea.help.helping
```

module.

The example code below shows how to
create this key pair and the associated agent registration plain text
using the python libnacl bindings for libsodium and the helper function.

```python
import libnacl
from bluepea.help.helping import makeSignedAgentReg

seed = libnacl.randombytes(libnacl.crypto_sign_SEEDBYTES)

verkey, sigkey = libnacl.crypto_sign_seed_keypair(seed)
# verkey is the public verification key
# sigkey is the private signing key

signature, registration = makeSignedAgentReg(verkey, sigkey)

# registration is the body text for the registration request. It is a json serialization
# signature is the Base64 URL safe encoding of theEdDSA signature of registration body

```

It is the responsibility of the client application to store the private signing
key as it will be needed to make any future changes to the resultant agent data
resource.

The request is made by sending an HTTP POST to ```/Agent/Registration```

The request includes a custom "Signature" header whose value is the signature
produced above. The request body is the registration text produced above.

A successful request results in a response with the associated Agent data resource
in the JSON body of the response is and a location header
whose value is the URL to access the Agent Data Resource via a GET request.
This location value has already been URL encoded.

A successful request will return status code 201

An unsuccessful request will return status code 400.

Example requests and responses are shown below.
